Project Overview
This project leverages supervised machine learning algorithms to build predictive models based on labeled datasets. Supervised learning involves training a model on input data (features) and corresponding output (labels or target variable) to make predictions on unseen data.

Algorithms Implemented
 Linear Regression
 Logistic Regression
 Decision Tree
 Random Forest
